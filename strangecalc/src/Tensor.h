 * \file Tensor.h
 * \ingroup wrapper
 *
 * This header defines 3 classes:
 * - TensorRank2
 * - TensorRank3
 * - TensorRank4
 *
 * These objects represent direct products of FourVector's:
 * - rank2 = a^{alpha} b^{beta}
 * - rank3 = a^{alpha} b^{beta} c^{gamma}
 * - rank4 = a^{alpha} b^{beta} c^{gamma} d^{delta}
 *
 * Common operations like +,-,* are provided.
 *
 * When the result of a multiplication is a FourVector, the overloaded
 * operator*() will return a Fourvector (= FourVector<> handle).
 * It is up to the user to cast it to the appropriate type when necessary.
