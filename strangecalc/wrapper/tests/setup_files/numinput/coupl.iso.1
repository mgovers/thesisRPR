The FINAL chi squared by temperature   0.01 is: 2.405698
(only low-energy data, including Graal)

This file contains the coupling constants resulting from a fit to the low- and high-energy data, including the NEW 2005 CLAS dataset, for cos theta > 0.35, and the new 2006 Graal data.  The low-energy data consisted of:
- diff. cross-sections from CLAS (2005), cos > 0.35
- diff. cross-sections from LEPS (2003)
- photon asymm. from LEPS (2003)
- recoil pol. from CLAS (2003)
- photon asymm. from GRAAL (2006)
- recoil pol. from GRAAL (2006)
A Gaussian strong form factor was used for the resonances. The cutoff is allowed to be between 1000 and  200 MeV. Background couplings were fixed.

This fit started from an input file containing:

1) the background coupling constants for g p -> K^+ L photoproduction, resulting from a fit to the high-energy data at forward angles:
- diff. cross-sections from Boyarski et al., PRL 22, 1131 (1969)
- photon asymm. from Quinn et al., PRD 20, 1553 (1979)
- recoil polarization from Vogel et al., Phys. Lett. B 40, 513 (1972). 
This fit used a rotating K and K^* traj. phase. The Born couplings were kept within their SU(3) limits, and the signs of the K^* ccs were fixed. The chi-squared when comparing the background to all high-energy datasets (with polariz weight 1) is 2.73.

2) the coupling constants of the "core" resonances as found in Stijn's model A: S11(1650), P11(1710), P13(1720), plus couplings for an extra P13(1900) resonance, with width = 500 MeV, and a missing D13(1895) state, with a width of 200 MeV. 

-----------------

The initial chi-squared when comparing background+core to the high- and low-energy data including the 2006 Graal data (pol weight 3), is 2.69.

The initial chi-squared when comparing background+core to just the low-energy data including the 2006 Graal data (pol weight 3), is 2.41.

The final chi-squared when comparing to the high-energy data is 4.91.

-----------------

When removing the resonances, the chi-squared when comparing to the high-energy data only is still reasonable (i.e lower than 3.5) when the ccs vary between:
S    P     -3.0e+00 -> -3.45e+00
T    K+    -3.0e+00 -> -3.45e+00
B    B1     2.6e-01 -> 3.2e-01 ; -1.0e+00 -> -7.0e-01
The same limits roughly keep on applying when the resonances are added.
